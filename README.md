# Bad Apple!! but I animated it using Spectrograms

This is a personal project where I re-created **Bad Apple!!** using spectrograms.

## Background: What’s “Bad Apple!!”?

**Bad Apple!!** is a black-and-white shadow-style animation that’s become an internet classic. Over the years, people have rebuilt it in every way imaginable, ASCII art, Minecraft redstone, Desmos, oscilloscopes, calculators, printers, apples, Roblox, you name it.

## Why I Did This

I’m currently working with RF signals and spectrograms at Purdue, so I wanted to see if I could “re-animate” Bad Apple!! through that lens. Instead of pixels on a screen, I map visuals into the time–frequency world and then render them as spectrogram frames. It’s part art, part signal-processing curiosity. Surprisingly, this project taught me a lot more about spectrograms and RF Signals in general.

## What I Actually Did (high level)

- Took the original Bad Apple!! video and broke it into frames.
- Turned each frame into a spectrogram-style image (brightness ≈ energy).
- Lined up all those spectrogram frames back into a video.
- Laid the original audio on top for sync.

The end result looks like a moving wall of frequencies—recognizably Bad Apple!!, but “spelled out” in the language of spectrograms. There’s a bit of blur: that’s normal for time–frequency windows and honestly adds to the vibe.

## What I Learned

- Spectrograms are a great bridge between pictures and sound—enough structure to be legible, enough softness to feel organic.
- Small choices (image height, window size, overlap) change the look a lot; there’s a spot where it reads clearly without looking clinical. The greatest example of this is the Time vs Frequency trade off, which is mentioned in my notes.
- Recreating a meme in a new medium is a fun way to test understanding without taking yourself too seriously (and have fun!). It's honestly nice to take a break from coursework to work on something you genuinely have fun with.

## Credits

- Original **“Bad Apple!!”** belongs to its creators.
- This remake is just for learning, fun, and showing what spectrograms can do.
